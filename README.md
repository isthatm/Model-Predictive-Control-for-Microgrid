# Model Predictive Cotrol for Microgrid

In this script the MPC model regulates power flow in real time within a microgrid containing wind power plant (source),

Li-ion batteries and fuel cells (storage devices) and households (loads). The objective is to minimize the use of 

fuel cell (cost function) and the change in power flow from/into storage devices.
